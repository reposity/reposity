<h2> <span class="B" id="Regular_season">Regular season</span></h2>
<p>Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late   September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players   (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare   the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man   active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the   regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than   two years of experience to the NBA development league. After training   camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches   are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and   overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.</p>
<p>During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and   away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16   games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in   its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams   three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the   other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure   means the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_schedule" title="Strength of schedule">strength of schedule</a> will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL" title="NFL">NFL</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB" title="MLB">MLB</a>).   Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their   division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road),   180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each   opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other   conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).</p>
<p>As of 2008, the NBA is one of only two of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada" title="Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada">major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada</a> in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>).   Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season.   For a few seasons until 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the   only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other   team.</p>
<p>The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> Day.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-Christmas-34">[34]</a> The league has been playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Christmas_games" title="National Basketball Association Christmas games">games</a> regularly on the holiday since 1947,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasMatchups-35">[35]</a> though the first Christmas Day games weren't televised until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NBA_season" title="1983–84 NBA season">1983–84</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasGamesOnTV-36">[36]</a> Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-Christmas-34">[34]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasMatchups-35">[35]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasGamesOnTV-36">[36]</a> Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when   the first NBA games air on network television each season.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasMatchups-35">[35]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-ChristmasGamesOnTV-36">[36]</a> Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.</p>
<p>In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_All-Star_Game" title="National Basketball Association All-Star Game">NBA All-Star Game</a>. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>,   and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a   starting spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to   choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face   the Western conference players in the All-Star game. The player with   the best performance during the game is rewarded with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game_MVP" title="NBA All-Star Game MVP">Game MVP award</a>. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie_Challenge" title="Rookie Challenge">Rookie Challenge</a>, where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play against each other in a 5-on-5 basketball game; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills_Challenge" title="Skills Challenge">Skills Challenge</a>, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Point_Contest" title="Three Point Contest">Three Point Contest</a>, where players compete to score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time; and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Slam_Dunk_Contest" title="NBA Slam Dunk Contest">NBA Slam Dunk Contest</a>,   where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way   according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names   which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming   rights.</p>
<p>Shortly after the All-Star break is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_deadline" title="Trade deadline">trade deadline</a>, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" title="Eastern Time Zone">Eastern Time</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-37">[37]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-38">[38]</a> After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each   other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and   release players. Major trades are often completed right before the   trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.</p>
<p>Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during   this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the   selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award">Sixth Man of the Year Award</a> is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Rookie of the Year Award">Rookie of the Year Award</a> is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award" title="NBA Most Improved Player Award">Most Improved Player Award</a> is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award">Defensive Player of the Year Award</a> is awarded to the league's best defender. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Coach of the Year Award">Coach of the Year Award</a> is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="NBA Most Valuable Player Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a> is given to player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_News" title="Sporting News">Sporting News</a></em> awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Executive_of_the_Year_Award" title="NBA Executive of the Year Award">Executive of the Year Award</a> to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.</p>
<p>The post-season teams are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team" title="All-NBA Team">All-NBA Team</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team" title="NBA All-Defensive Team">All-Defensive Team</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Rookie_Team" title="NBA All-Rookie Team">All-Rookie Team</a>;   each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams,   consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status   being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting   of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie   teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position<span class="B">.</span></p>

<p>NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with eight teams in each conference   going for the Championship. The three division winners, along with the   team with the next best record from the conference are given the top   four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are given the lower   four seeds.</p>
<p>Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed   begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed   plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the   fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team   faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the   better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. This   means that, for example, if the team who receives the 5 seed has a   better record than the team with the 4 seed (by virtue of a divisional   championship), the 5 seed would have home court advantage, even though   the other team has a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best   regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage   in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets" title="Denver Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a>,   who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although   Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court   advantage and won the series in 5.</p>
<p>The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent   in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games   advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from   the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against   another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each   conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not   re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional   design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded   teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded   teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded   teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded   teams. In every round except the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals" title="NBA Finals">NBA Finals</a>,   the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning   that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the   other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. For the NBA Finals, the series   follows a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in   games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and   5. The 2–3–2 pattern has been in place since 1985.</p>
<p>The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals" title="NBA Finals">NBA Finals</a>, and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy" title="Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy">Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy</a>.   Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general   manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition,   the league awards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award">Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award</a> to the best performing player of the series.</p>
<p>On August 2, 2006, the NBA announced the new playoff format. The new   format takes the three division winners and the second-place team with   the best record and rank them 1–4 by record. The other 4 slots are   filled by best record other than those other 4 teams.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-39">[39]</a> Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.</p>
